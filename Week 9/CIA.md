CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity, Authenticity

These are the pillars of cybersecurity.

They help us to design secure systems!

## Confidentiality

When you hear this word, I want you to think: ENCRYPTION. 

Confidentiality is the protection of privacy. It ensures that no unauthorised user can read data unintended for them.

## Integrity

When you hear this word, I want you to think: HASHING.

This pillar is concerned with ensuring the integrity of our data, i.e., making sure that whatever we send over the internet has not been tampered with.

## Authenticity

When you hear this word, I want you to think: DIGITAL SIGNATURES.

Using a private key to **sign** data affords an authentication protocol. Simply put, digital signatures are like our hand-written signatures, those who receive our digital signatures can decrypt them with our public key (which we can assume EVERYONE has a copy of) and if the result is legible, we can assume the decryption was successfully and thus - the message MUST have come from us since we are the only entities with a copy of our private key. 

This is why it's so important to NEVER give away your private key.
