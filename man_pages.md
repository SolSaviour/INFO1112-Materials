# How to use the Man Pages

So you need to know how to use a command? Man pages to the rescue.

`man sort`

The above command will show you a nice output of all the capabilities of this command. 

A super useful technique is to search this document for keywords that might relate to what you're searching for!

Let's say for example you need to know how to sort in reverse order.

Hit the forward slash key ("/") and type the word "reverse" before hitting enter.

This will highlight all occurrences of the word "reverse". Cycle through these using the "n" key and cycle backwards by pressing Shift + "n".

Hope this helps!!
