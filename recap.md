- converting numbers to binary and vice versa (know 2s compliment) **
- converting between different bases (decimal to hex)
- user mode vs system mode (what is the kernel, why is it important?)
- absolute vs relative paths **
- what is an interrupt (week 2 - processes)
- program vs process
- chmod command and visualising permissions (i.e., drwx---r-x) **
- system calls (know fork, exec, and wait!)
- what is an environment variable?
- what is virtual memory? Why do we need it?
- nice vs renice (why do we need priorities and scheduling?)
- what is the init process?
- Define: MBR, GRUB, BIOS, kernel
- bit shifting and bit masking (using them in working examples) **
- emulators vs virtual machines (benefits of each - learn the examples from the slides)
- purpose of containers and their benefits (learn the examples from the slides)
- packet vs circuit switching
- Define: LAN, WAN, TCP/IP, IP, Protocol
- TCP vs UDP (have examples for each)
- basic understanding of each layer of the TCP/IP model (have a protocol example for each layer)
- IPv4 vs IPv6, why are we moving towards IPv6?
- understand the basic concept behind ARP, DNS, NAT, and DHCP ("what" and "why")
- interpret ping, traceroute, dig (learn record types - A, AAAA, MX) outputs
- what is a port?
- understand why and when we use encryption (asymmetric - RSA | symmetric - AES) and hashing (MD5, SHA256)
- what is a digital signature? encrypting using the private key, why does that work?
- define serverless computing
- Define: windows server (X-windows), JVM, Dalvik, HAL, Bionic
- what is: XML, JSON, API and why are they important?
- learn bash if statements, for and while loops, basic commands including:
* cut, head, tail, grep (with flags), regex patterns *[](){}^.$ and using escape characters "/"
* ls, cp, rm, mv, cd, cat, read (with while loops for file reading)
* echo, find (with flags), sort, tr, incrementing variables
